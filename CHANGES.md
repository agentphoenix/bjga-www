# Release 2 (11.01.2012)

* Started work on the front page. Still trying to flesh out some ideas, but you get a very rough idea of putting the lesson and school stuff front and center with a third option for any other special or event you want to promote.
* Worked on the contact page more. At this point, everything goes to me. That'll obviously be changed when this goes live. There are 2 forms at the moment, a general questions form and a golf schools form. You can toggle between them to see how they're different. There will be a clinics version too. If you want any other items to have their own contact page, let me know which and what fields you want in there. I didn't collect address on the schools form (oversight on my part). If you really need it, I can put it in, but if you don't, I think it's one of those things best left out.
* Added all the testimonials you've sent to this point and tweaked the layout of the page a little bit.
* Updated the relationships page with the content I have so far. I pulled the USchedule logo off their website. If they want me to use something else, that's fine, but the ones they sent looked terrible.
* Created the page about your philosophy and approach. The text has been changed from what you sent, but just for flow and clarity.
* Created the private instruction page. I ended up writing my own intro. After putting what you sent in, it just felt way too long and drawn out. I think this works better for how I envisioned the page. If we need more content, that's easy enough to do.
* Created the golf schools page. I didn't touch any of the content here, mainly because there's a metric ton of it. There are also links on the righthand side to navigate quickly to the different sections. I renamed "Womens-only" to "Ladies-only". I figured it sounds a little better and after all, it is the Ladies Professional Golf Association. Easy enough to change back if you want.
* Removed student achievements page
* Added new image to the Teaching Philosophy page

## In Development

* Juniors Golf page
* Clinics page (I have everything I need for this, just need to build it)
* ECoaching page (not sure if you want a whole page for this or if it should be part of the Private Instruction page)
* Events (we'll need to figure out how to pull events from USchedule ... I'll talk to Ross about this, assuming you have events in there now that I can use as test material)
* I won't start the blog until the site is completely finished. Can't promise the blog for December 1st, but by the start of the new year for sure. I'll do my best though.
