	<h1>Junior Academy</h1>

	<p>In our passion to further develop youth to reach their true potential in the game of golf, Brian Jacobs Golf is introducing the Brian Jacobs Golf Junior Academy. We're the <strong>Home of Junior Golf</strong> and we need you and your child!</p>

	<p>We're searching for 9-17 year old boys and girls who are ready to be the best they can be!</p>

	<p>Brian Jacobs Golf offers our athletes authentic, consistent, progression-based instruction to produce measureable results. Plain and simple, we build winners.</p>

	<p>Not only are we the Home of Junior Golf, but we're also a place for parents/guardians to feel welcome and wanted! We encourage interaction with the staff and getting involved by coming one day per month and participating in the day your child experiences at no extra cost. Parents/guardians will experience fitness, instruction, lunch and play right by their child's side.</p>
