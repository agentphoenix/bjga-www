			<h1>Brian Jacobs Golf Schools</h1>

			<p>Brian Jacobs Golf Schools have a simple objective: provide you with the exemplary instruction, service and golfer experience.</p>

			<p>We believe in personalized instruction to better understand your game, the process of fixing your errors and the approach to improving your game for the future. You will learn the importance of ball flight, how to recognize your critical errors as they occur and how to correct them with the goal of improved play and having more fun.</p>

			<h3>Personalized Instruction</h3>

			<p>We teach either 1:1 or 2:1 golf schools because we believe this personalized attention creates more rapid progress, greater learning retention and allows us to customize a program for your individual needs based on our comprehensive assessments.</p>

			<p>In a 1:1 student to teacher ratio you receive 100% of your instructor's time and energy which increases learner retention and accelerates student progress. The majority of today's golf schools are "group" type schools with 4, 5, or even up to 8 students with one instructor. In a group atmosphere the instructor can only give basic tips to golfers of different ability levels and with different swing faults. Personal attention from your instructor is limited to only a few minutes each hour. During our One-on-One private schools you'll receive 60 minutes of each hour with your private swing coach.</p>

			<h3>The Best Instruction</h3>

			<p>All instruction is taught by PGA Class-A certified professionals and Hank Haney Golf Certified Instructors and based on practical, technical experience and formal training of swing plane mechanics taught through the Hank Haney Certified method. In 2009, Golf Digest ranked Hank as one of the top 2 teachers in the world and he has successfully taught numerous Tour Players and high level amateurs including Tiger Woods.</p>

			<h3>On Course Instruction</h3>

			<p>Each day will include on course time with your instructor to allow you the opportunity to learn in real playing conditions. On course you will receive instruction in situational application, club selection, mental game and pre-shot process, short game, etiquette and rules of golf. The on-course time allows you to take what you have learned from the practice range to the golf course and build confidence.</p>

			<h3>A Facility Designed for Optimal Learning</h3>

			<p>The land on which <a href="http://millcreekgolf.com" target="_blank">Mill Creek Golf Club</a> sits plays on, off and around the highest point in Monroe County with views to the east of the Rochester skyline and the rolling hills of the Finger Lakes to the south. Rochester's newest 18 hole championship course integrates the spirit of the unique glacial drumlin that bisects 320 acres of forested rolling hills, windswept fescues, rock creeks and waterfalls. The renowned golf course design team of Raymond Hearn and Paul Albanese has created this unique course by blending the natural aesthetics of the land with the risk/reward factors of a well-crafted challenge. The intent is to deliver the most memorable experience to golfers of all skill levels.</p>

			<p>Five sets of tees accommodate the novice and challenge the expert by adjusting the angle and length of the course from less than 5,000 to over 7,000 yards based on the player's ability. Each player has a similar experience from tee to green, meshing mature trees and lush, bent grass fairways, greens and bunkers. Mill Creek offers large bent grass greens that are unique in design and construction.</p>

			<p>The 23-acre Practice Center at Mill Creek Golf Club accommodates all levels of golfer serious about their game. The bent grass driving range has over 400 yards of hitting area with six target greens. The short game practice area includes three separate greens for chipping, putting and bunker play (with purchase of range balls). With teaching professionals on site, there is no better facility to sharpen your game.</p> 
 
			<h3>Ease of Scheduling</h3>

			<p>Due to the nature of the golf schools offered you can start any day of the week as long as we have availability. You chose the dates that work for you and your schedule and we'll design a custom program to accommodate your needs.</p>

			<h3>Continuation Program</h3>

			<p>We offer an extensive continuation program in which you can call or email your instructor. You may also send a video of your swing for an ecoach review and feedback or continue your education in a private lesson setting. (Private lessons and/or video ecoach requires an additional fee.)</p>
