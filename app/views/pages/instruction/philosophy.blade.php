	<p>At Brian Jacobs Golf our Instructors work tirelessly each day to be the leaders in player development and management, providing first class service, instructional programs and club fitting to all levels of golfers.</p>

	<p>We have two simple goals: make instruction a positive experience each student looks forward to and ensure each student leaves better than when they arrived. We strive to make the game of golf, lessons or schools informative and fun for the student! Students are expected to attain, through our teaching approach, a better understanding of what needs to be accomplished to produce better and more consistent results which will lower scores and increase their enjoyment of the game.</p>

	<h3>Our Approach</h3>

	<p>We start by analyzing a student's current ball flight tendencies (slice or hook), their swing plane (upright or flat) and impact position (open, closed or square). With this information, we're able to create and implement a plan of change to correct the critical errors that result in poor shots, frustration and higher scores.</p>

	<p>Our goal is to always be positive and create positive change, consistency and control of the ball flight for every shot within the game of golf. There are a variety of factors that lead to consistency, but none more important than the proper swing plane. To achieve this, it's necessary to <em>move</em> students to the proper positions repeatedly until the movement becomes a pattern. This approach separates and distinguishes Brian Jacobs Golf instructors and the experience each student has versus the competition. In our experience, moving the student produces more rapid results as well as a more thorough understanding of any errors and how to correct that error immediately.</p>
