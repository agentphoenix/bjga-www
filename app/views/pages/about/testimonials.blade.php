		<p class="lead">Most golfers think they will get better, most won't. If you're serious about improving and reaching your next goal, you must commit to your game, and it is vital that you consistently work with a great instructor. I've worked with many, <em>none is as excellent as Brian Jacobs</em>.</p>

				Brian is a fantastic coach. He teaches in an atmosphere where his students are always enjoying themselves and appreciating the game. My son, who has loved the game since he was five, was playing with just his natural athletic ability before he met Brian. But Brian molded his swing so that he consistently hits the ball cleanly and accurately.  What a change! I wish we had signed on with Brian years ago!

				When attempting to pull together a semi-private lesson for 3 families with 3 different schedules Brian was extremely flexible and patient in working with me and ensuring he could meet our needs for getting the group lesson on the calendar. Once the lessons began our children (boys) thoroughly enjoyed the lessons together and came away with great knowledge of the game and the improvement in their skills was amazing to all of us!

				I came from Milan, Italy to spend a week with Brian at his academy and learn from who I had researched was the best to learn from. My research paid off! Brian is a fantastic instructor and has a lot of patience...even with a grown up kid like me! We have set up ambitious golf targets which I am confident I will reach based on his clear plan, instruction and support!

		<p class="lead">Brian and I started working together in 2010 right after graduating from college. To say the least I was a mess, fighting swing changes, mental demons, and on the verge of a career choice. Within 2 months Brian tuned my swing and refocused my mind which led to my qualifying for the U.S Amateur. From day one I was committed to Brian and his approach to the game. I will not name names but I have been to a few of the countries top rated teachers which gave me empty pockets and a quick fix, not something that any golfer needs, at any level. Until Brian, I have never worked with someone so passionate, excited, and determined to get his students at a level where they continue to get better. Brian has the ability to teach you the game so that you continue to advance and don't have to run back to him every time something is out of whack; even though you will to see what else you can learn. This <em>quality and expertise is what separates Brian from so many teachers</em> who are just there for a profit.</p>

		<p class="lead">What I like most is the confidence I feel each time I have a session with him. <em>Brian is by far is the best teacher I have ever worked with</em>. My swing is powerful, accurate, and my body has no pain.</p>

		<p class="lead">Currently I am competing on mini tours in Arizona. Brian and I do most lessons over the phone but when I do get to see him, I spend as much time with him as possible. <em>I believe and trust everything that Brian teaches</em>. I have seen my game advance more in the last 3 years than the eight years of high school through college. Brian continues to push my game, challenge my mental sharpness and keep me relaxed about my career. Together we will make it to the PGA Tour. With his help he can take anyone to a higher level than they are now.</p>

				I have been an avid golfer for most of my life. I have tried to get my 12 year old son interested in it for 3 years with no real result. This summer my son spent just 1 day with Brian at his clinic and he was hooked. Brian not only taught him how to play better but made golf fun for him. Thanks Brian for the way you teach, inspire and make us all better golfers and people.

				Brian Jacobs is a dedicated and gifted golf coach and teacher. He helped our son not only excel on the golf course, but helped him evolve into the young man he was destined to become. He has been there every step of the way. From the moment he began coaching him at age 11, he was invested in his success as coach, teacher, and mentor. Brian will always be a part of our son's life, as well as ours as a family. Anyone who has the opportunity to train, work, or be coached by Brian Jacobs will find that their achievements are limited only by the limits of their dreams. If someone has a goal and dream, and works hard, Brian will stay they course, every step of the way, and help them achieve all that is possible.

				Knowing and working with Brian has not only improved my golf swing, it has changed my life. His ever present positive approach to conquering change and overcoming challenge extend far beyond the game of golf itself. Thanks to Brian, I'm now far more prepared, capable and confident when I slip into one of life's many "sand traps."

				While reflecting on the time I've spent with Brian, one thing keeps coming to mind: I do not think I have ever heard him say one negative thing about my game or swing on the range or on the course. Even when talking about areas where I know I need a lot of work, the tone was always positive and never detrimental or derisive. That kind of positive attitude is important to me in finding a compatible coach. Anyone that has ever played at highly competitive levels knows that at some point it stops being all about your swing and more about what's going on upstairs, and Brian also taught me the inestimable value of positive thinking on the course.

				Brian's skills as professional educator as well as a golf pro made a huge difference in my game; when I started with Brian I could barely put together a scoring round and by the end of two years of work I had won my flight in the Irondequoit Country Club championship and lowered my handicap by 9 strokes.
